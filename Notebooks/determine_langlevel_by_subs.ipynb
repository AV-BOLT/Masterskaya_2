rabid dog.  i'm not suggesting  he's sick. a sick man. we start down that road where do we draw the line the line's pretty clear. zero tolerance for walkers  or them to be.  what if we can get him help i heard the cdc was working on a cure. i heard that too. heard a lot of things before the world went to hell. what if the cdc is still up and running  man that is a stretch right there.  rick why if there's any government left any structure at all they'd protect the cdc at all costs wouldn't they i think it's our best shot. shelter protection okay rick you want those things all right i do too okay now if they exist they're at the army base. fort benning. that's 100 miles in the opposite direction. that is right. but it's away from the hot zone. now listen to me. if that place is operational it'll be heavily armed. we'd be safe there. rick the military were on the front lines of this thing. they got overrun. we've all seen that. the cdc is our best choice and jim's only chance. you go looking for aspirin do what you need to do. someone needs to have some balls to take care  of this damn problem  hey hey hey we don't kill the living. that's funny coming from a man who just put a gun to my head. we may disagree on some things not on this. you put it down. go on.  come with me.  where are you taking me somewhere safe. i came to pay my respects. did i ever mention how i lost my wife  cancer wasn't it  yeah. i dragged her to every doctor every test. and after all the surgeries and the chemos she was ready. she accepted it you know but i never could. and i spent the last few years so angry. i felt so cheated. since she passed you girls were the first people... that i cared anything for. this is her birthday her birthday was always like like a week long affair. but i somehow always missed it. i was away at college or too busy for kid's parties. she'd call all excited. i always said that i'd make it home and i really always meant to but i never made it past

you'd have stayed here if you'd have looked after your own instead you went off. you took half our manpower with you. i'm thinking maybe our losses wouldn't have been so bad. if we hadn't gone off and brought those guns back when we did i think our losses would have been a lot worse.  maybe the entire camp.   truck approaching   exhales  i still think it's a mistake not burning these bodies. it's what we said we'd do right burn âem all wasn't that the idea shane at first. the chinaman gets all emotional says it's not the thing to do we just follow him along these people need to know who the hell's in charge here  what the rules are.  there are no rules. lori well that's a problem. we haven't had one minute to hold onto anything of our old selves. we need time to mourn and we need to bury

promise you that. not for anything. now give me a chance to discuss some things with your mom okay  yeah.  rick all right. all right. shane blames me for not being here. do you we got guns now. we're stronger. and we have fewer people. that makes us weaker. you want me to say i think you were right i understand that. all i can say is that neither one of you is entirely wrong. it's the best i can do right now. what about the cdc  rick  we're at the ragged edge here. we need relief and we got a sick man who needs help. i don't know why people can't see that. well look at their faces. look at mine. we're all terrified. if one of us suggested based on a hunch that we head toward that city you'd have no part of it. tell me something with certainty. i love you. that's that's all that's all i got. i love you too.  door opens   knocks  his fever is worse. you need anything uh... water. could use more water.  lori i'll get some.  okay. lori carol you help me you save a grave for me nobody wants that. jim it's not about what you want. that uh that sound you hear that's god laughing while you make plans. what i want jim if if god allows is to get you some help.  groans   coughing   spits

to play the dutiful wife but you can't tell me that fixing your marriage is worth putting people's lives at risk. i think folks around here can make up their minds without bringing my marriage into it. it's a habit you need to break. i guess i'll just add it to the list of habits that i'm breaking whether i like it or not. what habits just talking about my need for a plan man. so what is it are we leaving or not maybe y'all just want to stay here. we could hang some more tin cans. we can't stay here. we both know that. i was just telling shane i think we should trust your gut. let's go do our sweep. shane tell you what man these people man they're not convinced. you know you head to the cdc you might be on your own. you gotta really consider whether you want to put lori and carl in that kind of spot. i got to do what's best for my family. best for your family what's that  exposing them to all kinds of risks  as opposed to what crossing 100 miles of hostile territory if we're looking for a lifeline i say swim toward the closest ship not further out to sea. why can't you back me up shane look i want to. it's just... i don't see it. if it was your family you'd feel differently. what did you say to me i kept âem safe man. i looked after them like they were no they were my own.  that's what i did rick.  shane i didn't mean it that way. well how'd you mean it go on
